        IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
        - ALL questions, options, and content MUST be in {language} language only.
        - Do NOT mix English with the target language.
        - Use proper script for the selected language.
        - Avoid repeating these questions: {previous}.
        - CRITICAL: Generate questions ONLY for {subject if subject else "the specified subject"}. Do NOT generate questions from other subjects.
     
        IMPORTANT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
        - Each question should have exactly 4 options as an array: ["option1", "option2", "option3", "option4"]
        - The answer should be the actual text of the correct option, NOT a letter
        - Each question MUST include a "hint" field that provides a helpful hint without revealing the answer
        - Return ONLY a JSON array with keys: question, options (array), answer (actual option text), hint
     
        Example format (in {language}):
        [
          {{
            "question": "[Question text in {language} related to {subject if subject else 'the topic'}]",

            "answer": "[Correct option text in {language}]",
            "hint": "[Helpful hint in {language} that guides the student without revealing the answer]"
          }}
        ]
     
        HINT GUIDELINES:
        - Hints should be educational and guiding, not direct answers
        - Provide clues about the concept or approach to solve
        - Mention relevant formulas or concepts to consider
        - Suggest steps to think through the problem
        - Keep hints concise and helpful

        {language_instruction}
     
        IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
        - ALL questions, options, and content MUST be in {language} language only.
        - Do NOT mix English with the target language.
        - Use proper script for the selected language.
        - Avoid repeating these questions: {previous}.
        - If you cannot generate all 50 unique questions, repeat some of the previous ones with slight modifications in wording, structure, or numerical values instead of adding placeholder questions.
        FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
        - Each question must have exactly 4 options as a JSON object {{"A": "option text", "B": "another option", "C": "third option", "D": "fourth option"}}.
        - The answer must be the label "A", "B", "C", or "D".
        - Each question MUST include a "hint" field that provides a helpful hint without revealing the answer
        - Return ONLY a JSON array of objects with keys: question, options, answer, hint
     
        Example format (in {language}):

          }}
        ]
     
        HINT GUIDELINES:
        - Hints should be educational and guiding, not direct answers
        - Provide clues about the concept or approach to solve
        - Mention relevant formulas or concepts to consider
        - Suggest steps to think through the problem
        - Keep hints concise and helpful for exam preparation

        - CRITICAL: Generate questions ONLY for {subject if subject else "the specified subject"}. Do NOT generate questions from other subjects.
       
        IMPORTANT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
        - Each question should have exactly 4 options as an array: ["option1", "option2", "option3", "option4"]
        - The answer should be the actual text of the correct option, NOT a letter
        - Return ONLY a JSON array with keys: question, options (array), answer (actual option text)
